            "text": "Once upon a time, in a small kingdom, there lived a young prince named Alexander. He was known for his bravery and kindness, but he felt unfulfilled, as if there was something missing from his life. One day, while wandering in the nearby woods, he stumbled upon a strange, overgrown path that he had never seen before.\n\nCurious, he followed the path, and it led him to a magnificent forest unlike any he had ever seen. The trees were so tall they seemed to reach the sky, and the leaves glimmered with an otherworldly light. As he walked deeper into the forest, Alexander felt a strange, enchanted feeling wash over him."
